# fusion-lib – Design Principles (Short)

fusion-lib is built on a few core ideas:

1. It is a toolbox, not a framework
2. It assumes server-rendered HTML
3. JavaScript is explicit and event-driven
4. PHP code is predictable and boring (by design)
5. No build steps, no package managers
6. Responsibility lies with the integrator
7. Backward compatibility is a priority

fusion-lib values clarity over abstraction and longevity over trends.
